## Task 0: get familiar with Git and GitHub
* [How to use Git and GitHub.png](https://github.com/serhii-r/kottans_frontend/blob/master/Task_0/How%20to%20use%20Git%20and%20GitHub.png)

I have just started my "coding path" so it was the first encounter with 
Git and GitHub - a lot of new staff for me, but I am managing :).
Huge "Thanks!" to those people who set all those tasks up and systemized 
the learning material - and I mean it. Frankly, if I hadn't participated in 
the completion of the Udacity course I don't know how long it would have taken me
to realize how important version control is.

## Task 1: learn some command line, server and http tools

* [Linux Command Line Basics.png](https://github.com/serhii-r/kottans_frontend/blob/master/Task_1/Linux%20Command%20Line%20Basics.png)
* [Networking for Web Developers.png](https://github.com/serhii-r/kottans_frontend/blob/master/Task_1/Networking%20for%20Web%20Developers.png)

I have never worked with the terminal before and I used to wonder – why would
you use it? After watching “Linux Command Line Basics” and “Configuring Linux Web Servers” 
I at least have a grasp why would you use Linux and how to work with shell commands 
in the terminal, but I feel like it’s a lot of learning waiting for me in the future :)
"Networking for Web Developers" is a great course the kind of I have been looking 
around for a while in order to understand how the Internet in general works. I hope 
I did get it, but it should definitely be re-watched.

## Task 2: Git and GitHub: Version control with Git and GitHub & Collaboration
* [GitHub & Collaboration.png](https://github.com/serhii-r/kottans_frontend/blob/master/Task_2/GitHub%20%26%20Collaboration.png)
* [What is Version Control.png](https://github.com/serhii-r/kottans_frontend/blob/master/Task_2/What%20is%20Version%20Control.png)

I liked these two courses more than the Udacity one in Task_0. The material represented here 
seems to be clearer and more understandable. I finally got how to review modified files and
hope to use this instrument in the future.

## Task 3: Intro to HTML & CSS
* [Intro to HTML & CSS.png](https://github.com/serhii-r/kottans_frontend/blob/master/Task_3/Intro%20to%20HTML%20%26%20CSS.png)

Finally, I have managed to reach the task which is not so "new information-intensive" for me. All in all it has been a great refresher :)

## Task 4: Responsive Web Design Fundamentals
* [Responsive Web Design Fundamentals.png](https://github.com/serhii-r/kottans_frontend/blob/master/Task_4/Responsive%20Web%20Design%20Fundamentals.png)

Really great course! A lot of material which you thought you knew is now more systemized. What I liked 
most is common responsive patterns (I used it before of course but the whole idea of patterns was
not that conceptualized for me).

## Task 5: Intro to JS
* [Intro to JS.png](https://github.com/serhii-r/kottans_frontend/blob/master/Task_5/Intro%20to%20JavaScript.png)

Nice refresher :)

## Task 6: Object Oriented JS
* [Object Oriented JS.png](https://github.com/serhii-r/kottans_frontend/blob/master/Task_6/Object%20Oriented%20JS.png)

Before I took the course I was not new to the concepts of scopes, closures, prototype chains, but for me
it has been difficult to follow the host. Maybe the couse is very intensive... Personally, I am a great fan of [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/) courses on Udemy :)

## Task 7: Offline Web Applications
* [Offline Web Applications.png](https://github.com/serhii-r/kottans_frontend/blob/master/Task_7/Offline%20Web%20Applications.png)
I have honestly watched the whole course, but the material seems to be pretty vague to me. Perhaps I should
take some other courses regarding server-side JS with a more entry level.
